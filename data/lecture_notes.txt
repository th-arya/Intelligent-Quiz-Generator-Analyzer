Python is a high-level programming language. Python was created by Guido van Rossum. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Variables in Python do not require explicit declaration. Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items. Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. Loops allow you to execute code repeatedly. Functions are reusable blocks of code. Modules help organize Python code into separate files. File handling enables reading and writing data to files. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Data structures organize and store data efficiently. Conditional statements control the flow of program execution. String manipulation is essential for text processing. Exception handling helps manage errors gracefully. Object-oriented programming uses classes and objects. Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties from other classes. Encapsulation hides internal implementation details. Polymorphism enables objects to take multiple forms. Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.
